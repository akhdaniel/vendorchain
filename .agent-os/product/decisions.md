## 2025-08-19: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Build a blockchain-based vendor contract management system using Hyperledger Fabric as the distributed ledger, Odoo 18 as the ERP frontend, and FastAPI as the gateway layer. The system will manage vendor contracts through a three-stage workflow (Creator → Verificator → Submitted), track payments and balances, and provide transparency to all parties while maintaining immutable audit trails.

### Context

Organizations face significant challenges in vendor contract management, including missed renewals, payment disputes, and compliance issues. Traditional systems lack transparency and create silos between departments and vendors. A blockchain-based solution provides an immutable single source of truth, while integration with Odoo ensures seamless adoption within existing ERP workflows. The market demands greater transparency and automation in vendor relationships, especially in regulated industries.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional Database-Only Solution**
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, lower infrastructure requirements, familiar technology
   - Cons: Lacks immutability, no distributed trust, vulnerable to data manipulation, limited transparency

2. **Public Blockchain (Ethereum)**
   - Pros: Fully decentralized, existing ecosystem, smart contract maturity
   - Cons: High transaction costs, slower performance, privacy concerns for enterprise data, regulatory challenges

3. **Standalone Blockchain Platform**
   - Pros: Purpose-built for contracts, optimized performance
   - Cons: No ERP integration, requires separate training, adoption barriers, duplicate data entry

### Rationale

Hyperledger Fabric was chosen for its enterprise-grade features, permissioned network capabilities, and privacy controls suitable for sensitive vendor data. Odoo 18 provides a mature ERP platform with existing business workflows, reducing adoption friction. FastAPI offers high-performance API gateway capabilities with automatic documentation generation. Docker Compose simplifies development and initial deployment while allowing future migration to Kubernetes.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Immutable audit trails for all contract activities
- Reduced contract disputes through transparency
- Automated workflows reducing manual processing by 70%
- Seamless integration with existing ERP systems
- Multi-party trust without intermediaries

**Negative:**
- Higher initial setup complexity than traditional solutions
- Requires blockchain expertise for maintenance
- Infrastructure overhead for running Fabric network
- Learning curve for development team on blockchain concepts

## 2025-08-19: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use Hyperledger Fabric 2.5+ for blockchain, Odoo 18 with Python 3.11 for ERP, FastAPI for API gateway, PostgreSQL 15+ for off-chain storage, and Docker Compose for containerization. Smart contracts will be written in JavaScript/TypeScript for better tooling support.

### Context

The technology stack needs to balance enterprise requirements, developer productivity, and system performance. The team has Python expertise, and the organization requires integration with existing PostgreSQL databases. Container orchestration is needed for managing the complex multi-service architecture.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Hyperledger Besu + Spring Boot + Angular**
   - Pros: Ethereum compatibility, mature Java ecosystem
   - Cons: Team lacks Java expertise, no native ERP integration

2. **Corda + .NET + React**
   - Pros: Built for financial contracts, strong privacy features
   - Cons: Licensing costs, limited Odoo integration options

### Rationale

The selected stack leverages the team's Python expertise while providing enterprise-grade blockchain capabilities. Odoo 18 offers the latest features with long-term support. Docker Compose provides sufficient orchestration for initial deployment with a clear path to Kubernetes for production scaling.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Leverages existing team skills in Python
- Native Odoo integration reduces development time
- Strong community support for all components
- Clear upgrade path for future scaling

**Negative:**
- JavaScript/TypeScript requirement for chaincode (different from application language)
- Docker Compose limitations for large-scale production deployment
- PostgreSQL and CouchDB dual database management

## 2025-08-19: Development Approach

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Process
**Stakeholders:** Development Team, QA Team

### Decision

Adopt a phased development approach with 5 distinct phases, starting with infrastructure setup, followed by core features, then advanced capabilities. Use monorepo structure with separate directories for each component. Implement Test-Driven Development (TDD) for critical smart contract functions.

### Context

The project's complexity requires a structured approach to manage dependencies and ensure stable incremental delivery. The team needs clear milestones and the ability to validate architecture decisions early.

### Rationale

Phased approach allows for early validation of blockchain infrastructure before building application features. Monorepo simplifies dependency management and ensures consistent versioning across components. TDD for smart contracts is critical due to the immutable nature of blockchain deployments.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear development milestones and progress tracking
- Early risk identification and mitigation
- Simplified dependency management
- Higher confidence in smart contract correctness

**Negative:**
- Longer initial setup phase before visible features
- Monorepo requires careful dependency management
- TDD may slow initial development velocity
