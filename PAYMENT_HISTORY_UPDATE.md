# Payment History List View Implementation

## Summary
The `action_view_payments` button has been updated to display a proper list view of payment records instead of just showing a notification with the payment count.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Payment History Model
**File**: `/odoo-addon/vendor_contract_management/models/payment_history.py`
- Created `vendor.contract.payment.history` model
- Stores individual payment records with full details
- Automatically updates contract paid amount
- Syncs with blockchain
- Posts messages to contract chatter

### 2. Payment History Views
**File**: `/odoo-addon/vendor_contract_management/views/payment_history_views.xml`
- List view with payment details and totals
- Form view for viewing individual payment details
- Search view with filters and grouping options
- Added Payment History tab to contract form

### 3. Updated Contract Model
**File**: `/odoo-addon/vendor_contract_management/models/contract.py`
- Added `payment_history_ids` One2many field
- Updated `action_view_payments` to return list view action
- Updated `_compute_payment_count` to use payment records

### 4. Updated Payment Wizard
**File**: `/odoo-addon/vendor_contract_management/wizard/payment_wizard.py`
- Now creates payment history records instead of updating JSON
- Returns action to view payment list after recording

### 5. Menu and Security
- Added "Payment History" menu under Reports
- Added security access rules for all user groups
- Updated manifest to include new views

## How It Works

### Recording a Payment
1. User clicks "Record Payment" button on contract
2. Payment wizard opens
3. User enters payment details
4. On confirmation:
   - Payment history record is created
   - Contract paid amount is updated
   - Message posted to contract chatter
   - Blockchain sync attempted
   - Payment list view is displayed

### Viewing Payment History
1. **From Contract**: Click the "Payments" button (shows count)
   - Opens filtered list of payments for that contract
   
2. **From Menu**: Navigate to Reports â†’ Payment History
   - Shows all payments across all contracts
   - Can filter, search, and group

### Features
- **List View**: Shows all payments with totals
- **Form View**: Detailed view of individual payments
- **Search**: Filter by method, date, contract, vendor
- **Grouping**: Group by contract, vendor, method, date
- **Blockchain**: Transaction IDs stored and displayed
- **Audit Trail**: Tracks who recorded and when

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
python3 scripts/test-payment-history-view.py
```

This will:
1. Create a test contract with vendor
2. Record 4 different payments
3. Verify payment count and totals
4. Test the view action returns correct data

## User Experience

### Before
- Clicking "View Payments" showed only a notification with payment count
- No way to see payment details
- JSON storage made it hard to query

### After
- Clicking "View Payments" opens a proper list view
- Full payment details visible
- Can filter, search, and export
- Dedicated menu item for all payments
- Payment history tab in contract form
- Proper database storage for reporting

## Migration

For existing contracts with JSON payment history:
```python
# Run in Odoo shell
env['vendor.contract.payment.history'].migrate_json_payments()
```

This will convert JSON payment history to proper payment records.
